 Send log for tagging a user (add or remove). For example, you can send user's birthday as {"key": "sh_date_of_birth", "value": "2012-12-12 11:11:11", "type": "datetime"}.
 @param dict The dictionary contains user profile information.

If data_value is a dictionary, use "string" as its type. 2. remove tag: {"key": key_string}.
 
 Code sample for add tag:
 `NSDictionary *dictWhen = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@"When", @"key", [NSDate date], @"value", @"datetime", @"type", nil];`
