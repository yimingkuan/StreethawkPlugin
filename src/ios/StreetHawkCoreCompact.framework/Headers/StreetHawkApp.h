/**
 The SHApp Class is core of whole SDK. It contains almost all the functions.
 
 **Normal usage:**
 
 - SHApp is singleton, access it by `[SHApp sharedInstance]` or `StreetHawk`.
 
 - When your Application starts, usually in `- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions`, call  `registerInstallForApp:withDebugMode:withiTunesId:` to initialize all required StreetHawk features.
 
     This is simple, here are a few lines of sample code: 
 
        [StreetHawk registerInstallForApp:appId(registered with the StreetHawk Cloud) withDebugMode:Yes withiTunesId:@"123456"(string id register in AppStore)];
 
 - Add tag for user is simple, code like:
 
        [StreetHawk tagString:@"a@a.com" forKey:@"sh_email"];
 
 - Submit friendly names, code like:
 
        SHFriendlyNameObject *name1 = [[SHFriendlyNameObject alloc] init];
        SHFriendlyNameObject *name2 = [[SHFriendlyNameObject alloc] init];
        SHFriendlyNameObject *name3 = [[SHFriendlyNameObject alloc] init];
        name1.friendlyName = FRIENDLYNAME_LOGIN;
        name1.vc = @"LogTagCasesViewController";
        name2.friendlyName = FRIENDLYNAME_REGISTER;
        name2.vc = @"LogTagCasesViewController";
        name3.friendlyName = @"Input iBeacon region";
        name3.vc = @"BeaconRegionInputViewController";
        name3.xib_iphone = @"BeaconRegionInputViewController";
        [StreetHawk shCustomActivityList:@[name1, name2, name3]];
 
 **Necessary project settings:**
 
 To have your StreetHawk-enabled Application work properly, some project settings are necessary. 
 
 - Add "-ObjC" into "Other Linker Flags". It's necessary for using SDK otherwise link error may occur for category methods.
 - Add resource bundle into project. It's necessary for SDK's xib and image resources.
 - Add "Background fetch" in "Background Modes", since iOS 7.
 - Add "NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription" or "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription" in Info.plist for enabling location service since iOS 8.
 - Because StreetHawk SDK uses significant location change at background, there is NO need to add "Required background modes" with *location service*.

 Push notification 8004/8006/8007 is to launch a certain view controller, however it's difficult for server to know "how to launch the view controller". In iOS platform it requires the following elements to initialize a view controller:

 * xib for iPhone -- optional, used for intialize the view controller on iPhone device, and xib name is different from class name; if nil use class name as the xib name.
 * xib for iPad -- optional, used for intialize the view controller on iPad device, and xib name is different from class name; if nil use class name as the xib name.
 
 For Phonegap App, it can be load an html page. Refer to `shPGHtmlReceiver` and `shPGLoadHtml`.
 
 Server may have problem to send push notification, because:
 
 * iOS and Android possibly have different class name, different mechanism to launch view controller. Need to consider the platform details.
 * Applications even running on the same platform can have different ac/vc names in different versions.
 
 To make server simpler in this aspect, client side provide a way to register "friendly name", while locally store the map for vc and xib. For example, client side can register: friendly name = "login", vc = "MyLoginViewController", xib_iphone = "MyLoginViewController_iphone", xib_ipad = "MyLoginViewController_ipad", so server display "login" in web console when sending push notification. After client side receive this notification, find vc and xib locally to initialize view controller.

 **Note 2: Use friendly name = "register" (FRIENDLYNAME_REGISTER) for register page, which can be specifically handled by 8006 push notification.
 **Note 3: Use friendly name = "login" (FRIENDLYNAME_LOGIN) for login page, which can be specifically handled by 8007 push notification.

 Handle open URL, customer's App must register "URL Types" in Info.plist with its own scheme. User App implement this function by calling it in AppDelegate.m if NOT auto-integrate. If `StreetHawk.autoIntegrateAppDelegate = YES;` make sure NOT call this otherwise cause dead loop. Code snippet:
    `- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation`
    `{`
        `return [StreetHawk openURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];`
    `}`
 
 This function performs following tasks:
 1. Deeplinking: open a view and call function of the view. The url must be formatted as: <url scheme>://launchvc?vc=<friendly name or vc>&xib_iphone=<xib_iphone>&xib_ipad=<xib_ipad>&<additional params>. "<url scheme>" must same as Info.plist register URL type; "launchvc" is pre-defined command, case insensitive; "vc" is friendly name or UIViewController's class name, mandatory; others are optional.
