 Handler to deal with crash. It uses open-source CrashReporter.framework. The usage is:
 
 * When App initialized, call `enableCrashReporter` to have crash handler get ready. 
 * If crash happen, the crash report is logged locally. Use `hasPendingCrashReport` to check whether local has pending crash report. 
 * If local has crash report, use `loadPendingCrashReport` to get the report data string. 
 * After send crash report to server, use `purgePendingCrashReport` to clear the local one.
